Here the interesting list of links related to information which
had been mining by google about you:

<a href="https://security.google.com/settings/security/permissions">
https://security.google.com/settings/security/permissions</a> -- list of apps,
binded to your google account.

<a href="https://www.google.com/takeout">
https://www.google.com/takeout</a> -- tool to export data from various
google-related sources like google+, contacts, maps history, etc.

<a href="https://maps.google.com/locationhistory">https://maps.google.com/locationhistory</a> --
places visited by you with chronology. Looks pretty interesting by the way :)

<a href="https://history.google.com">https://history.google.com</a> --
the history of your google searching, also looks pretty interesting.

<a href="https://security.google.com/settings/security/activity">https://security.google.com/settings/security/activity</a> --
the list of your recently(for the last 28 days) used devices. It is interesting by
security reasons.

Also all of those sources can be cleaned up ;)
