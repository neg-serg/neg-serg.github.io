Once upon a time I found this interesting site: <a
href="http://everynoise.com/engenremap.html">http://everynoise.com/engenremap.html</a>.
You can discover various new musical genres and "tags". Maybe it does not
contains all the tags/genres ever, like oceangrunge for example, but anyway
idea looks interestring.
